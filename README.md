# TESLA STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING FACEBOOK PROPHET
In this project, we learned to import libraries and dataset and create a Facebook Prophet machine learning model in order to forecast the price of Tesla 30 days into the future. We also learned how to extract Financial data in Google Sheets using Google Finance and compared the forecasted data with the actual data and evaluated the performance of the model. We then performed the stock analysis of Tesla and automated the entire forecasting process. 

The same skills can also be applied to analyze any stock of your choice. So feel free to implement what you have learned to any other stock of your choice.
